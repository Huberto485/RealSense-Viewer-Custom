# RealSense-Viewer-Custom
Custom made viewer for Intel's RealSense Depth Camera D435.

The viewer currently allows you to do these features:
-Use a RealSense Depth Camera D435 or others
-Stream depth data
-View live depth data
-Save depth data as video
-Save depth data as image
-Load depth data from drive
-Read depth data loaded
-View pixel depth values on screen

The viewer is set to expand to allow you to do these additional features:
<NO FEATURES PLANNED>

Current limitations:
-A loaded video has to be viewed until the end.
-An image is effectively a very short video - same limitation as above.
-Sometimes videos or images cannot be loaded due to an indexing bug from realsense2 SDK.
-Other minor errors.

This viewer has been developed by one person with limited knowledge of C# so any help/tips are welcome!
